.SH NAME
ezfsck \- a script that performs fsck on all disk partitions of
types UFS/Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 listed in /etc/fstab

.SH SYNOPSIS
ezfsck addresses the minor task of iterating over disk partitions
for fsck operations after a bad shutdown. The script carries out fsck
on all partitions of type ufs/ext2fs/ext3fs/ext4fs listed in /etc/fstab.
By default, only hard-disk partitions of type /dev/ada* are operated
on, but you can pull in other types (/dev/da* ; /dev/nvd*) as well
via command-line options.

Since ezfsck has to work portably between BSD fsck and Linux fsck, the
only fsck arguments that are meaningful are -f and -y, which work
exactly the same across fsck implementations. Luckily, -fy is all that
is usually needed for a good fsck operation and is always passed in as
hard-wired by the ezfsck implementation.

.SH USAGE
To carry out fsck on all /dev/ada* partitions listed in /etc/fstab, use:

ezfsck

To additionally check /dev/nvd* partitions (besides /dev/ada*), use:

ezfsck --nvme

To additionally check /dev/da* partitions (besides /dev/ada*), use:

ezfsck --removable

To fsck all partitions (/dev/ada* ; /dev/da* ; /dev/nvd*), use:

ezfsck --all

.SH RETURN VALUES
255 is returned for operational failure resulting from bad user input.

0 is returned if all fsck operations completed successfully.

If fsck fails, the return value of the last fsck operation is returned.

e2fsck(8)

.SH BUGS/LIMITATIONS
ezfsck carries out fsck twice, the second op forced if the first op
does not report 0 (and the second op skipped if the first op succeeds
with the exit code 0).

Unlike BSD fsck (which always returns 0 on success), Linux fsck
programs (fsck.ext2; fsck.ext3; fsck.ext4) return 1 or 2 on success if a
partition had errors but was successfully corrected. This results in the
fallacy that ezfsck carries out fsck on dirty Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 partitions
twice even if the first op was successful and sufficient by itself.
